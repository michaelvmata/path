    Name: Dimensional tether
    Description: |
      This is a simple yard, with bare walls of smoothly cut stone towering
      over you. The sky above is obscured by a heavy blanket of clouds,
      leaving the yard in a gray, diffused light. The ground beneath your feet
      is made of the same smoothly cut stone as the walls.  In the middle of
      the yard, you see a swirling, pulsating mass of energy hanging a few feet
      in the air. The edges of the mass are composed of dark purple hues that
      periodically ripple in brightness. It's as if you're staring at a
      curtain of energy, with a window to another realm at its center. The
      window contains nothing at all, but conveys a sense of an infinite
      expanse, as if you were staring into an abyss that stretches on forever.

    Name: Spiral hallway
    Description: |
      The hallway has more of the same smoothly cut stone, barren of any
      detail, on both walls.  Overhead, however, the walls curve to form a
      ceiling.  In the center of the ceiling, a row of runes runs parallel
      with the hallway.  The runes glow with an iridescent light,
      illuminating the entire hallway.  There is a doorway to the south, and
      the hallway continues to the east.

    Name: Spiral hallway
    Description: |
      The spiraling hallway continues with the same smoothly cut stone, bare
      of any details. As you round the bend, the ceiling arches above you,
      creating a sense of grandeur. The walls curve seamlessly into the
      ceiling, forming a continuous, uninterrupted surface. In the center of
      the ceiling, a row of glowing runes runs parallel with the hallway,
      casting an iridescent light that illuminates the entire passageway.
      There is a doorway to the east, and the hallway continues to the north.

      air of mystery to the room.
