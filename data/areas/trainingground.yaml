    Description: |
      You feel a connection to the portal, as if it were anchoring you to

    Name: Dimensional tether
    Description: |
      This is a plain yard with bare walls of smoothly cut stone.  The sun
      hangs high overhead behind a heavy blanket of clouds.  The ground is
      made of the same smoothly cut stone as the walls and is equally bare.
      Hanging a few feet in the air is a swirling, pulsating mass of energy.
      The edges are composed of dark purple hues that periodically ripple
      in brightness.  The center looks like a window to another realm,
      containing nothing at all, but conveying a sense of an infinite expanse,
      as if you were staring into an abyss.

    Name: Spiral hallway
    Description: |
      The hallway has more of the same smoothly cut stone, barren of any
      detail, on both walls.  Overhead, however, the walls curve to form a
      ceiling.  In the center of the ceiling, a row of runes runs parallel
      with the hallway.  The runes glow with an iridescent light,
      illuminating the entire hallway.  There is a doorway to the south, and
      the hallway continues to the east.
